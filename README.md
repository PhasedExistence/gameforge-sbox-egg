# GameForge s&box Egg

This repository contains Pterodactyl and Pelican eggs and container build assets for running an s&box dedicated server with Wine on Linux. It also includes an opt-in native Linux Pterodactyl egg built from a pinned `Facepunch/sbox-public` commit while a stable native Steam depot is unavailable.

This is working in production. We use it to offer s&box server hosting: [Looking for a server?](https://gameforge.gg/games/sbox)

## Primary Goal

Provides a production-ready egg that:
- provides ease of use variables for the server.
- runs as non-root in container environments.
- runs SteamCMD on every boot to keep the server up to date.
- A single stage runtime image based on `steamcmd/steamcmd:alpine` that uses steamcmd to download and keep sbox updated.

## Repository Layout

- `sandbox-pterodactyl.json` — Pterodactyl egg export.
- `sandbox-pelican.json` — Pelican egg export.
- `sandbox-pterodactyl-linux-native.json` — validated, commit-pinned native Linux alternative.
- `sandbox-pterodactyl-wine-managed.json` — validated managed-console Wine alternative.
- `VALIDATED_EGGS.md` — image pins, deployment requirements, and panel/client acceptance results.
- `Yolk/Dockerfile` — Docker image build.
- `Yolk/entrypoint.sh` — Runtime startup and orchestration logic.

## Egg Focus

The primary Pterodactyl and Pelican egg files are functionally identical — they share the same Docker image, startup command, variables, and runtime behavior. The two additional Pterodactyl imports use separately validated Sacred Servers images and do not change the primary GameForge runtime.

Key details:
- Startup command: `start-sbox`
- Done detection: `Loading game|Server started` (This triggers when sbox finishes loading rather than when the game mode loading)`

## Panel Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GAME` | Primary game package (`+game`) | `strikeforce.strikeforce` |
| `SERVER_NAME` | Public server name | `Sandbox Server` |
| `MAP` | Optional map/package identifier | `Empty` |
| `SBOX_PROJECT` | Local `.sbproj` under `/home/container/projects/` | |
| `SBOX_EXTRA_ARGS` | Extra launch arguments | |
| `SBOX_AUTO_UPDATE` | Run SteamCMD update on each boot (`0`/`1`) | `1` |
| `SBOX_BRANCH` | Steam beta branch for updates (e.g. `staging`) | |
| `TOKEN` | Steam game server token | |
| `STEAMCMD_EXTRA_ARGS` | Extra Args for SteamCMD | |

## Runtime Behavior

At container start, `Yolk/entrypoint.sh`:
1. SteamCMD will validate and update s&box as required into `/home/container/sbox`.
2. Launches `sbox-server.exe` under Wine with the configured arguments.
3. Logs into `/home/container/logs`

If SteamCMD times out or fails but a previous `sbox-server.exe` exists, startup continues with existing files and the updater error is logged to `logs/sbox-update.log`.

## Quick Start

1. Import the appropriate egg into your panel:
  - **Pterodactyl**: import `sandbox-pterodactyl.json`
  - **Pelican**: import `sandbox-pelican.json`
2. Set the Docker image to `ghcr.io/GameForgeGG/sbox-egg:latest` (or your own build).
3. Create a server and configure variables.
4. Start the server. On first boot it will seed files and run the updater before launching.

For the native public-source or managed-console Wine alternatives, import the matching `sandbox-pterodactyl-*.json` file and follow [`VALIDATED_EGGS.md`](VALIDATED_EGGS.md). Both alternatives require separate UDP game and query allocations.

## Notes for Hosting Providers

While this egg was built for [GameForge](https://gameforge.gg) to sell s&box hosting, we are happy to see other providers use it and welcome pull requests.
